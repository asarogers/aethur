The system implements the complete control law in task space using the following mathematical formulation:

$$V = [\text{Ad}_{X^{-1}X_d}]V_d + K_p X_{\text{err}} + K_i \int X_{\text{err}}$$

## Parameter Definitions

**Where:**

- **$V_d$**: Feedforward twist from desired poses
  - Represents the desired velocity trajectory in the task space
  - Provides proactive control based on reference motion

- **$X_{\text{err}}$**: Error twist
  - Quantifies the deviation between current and desired pose
  - Expressed in the appropriate Lie algebra representation

- **$K_p, K_i$**: Gain matrices
  - $K_p$: Proportional gain matrix for immediate error correction
  - $K_i$: Integral gain matrix for steady-state error elimination
  - Tuned to achieve desired closed-loop performance characteristics

- **$J^+$**: Pseudo-inverse of the manipulator Jacobian
  - Maps task space velocities to joint space velocities
  - Handles redundancy resolution when applicable
  - Ensures kinematic consistency between task and joint spaces

## Control Architecture Features

### Feedforward Component
The $[\text{Ad}_{X^{-1}X_d}]V_d$ term provides predictive control action based on the desired trajectory, reducing tracking errors and improving dynamic response.

### Feedback Components
- **Proportional Control**: $K_p X_{\text{err}}$ provides immediate corrective action proportional to the current error
- **Integral Control**: $K_i \int X_{\text{err}}$ eliminates steady-state errors and compensates for model uncertainties

### Mathematical Rigor
The formulation leverages Lie group theory through the adjoint representation $\text{Ad}_{X^{-1}X_d}$, ensuring geometrically consistent operations on the configuration manifold.
